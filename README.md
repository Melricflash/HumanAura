HumanAura - Simple Human Detection & Tracking system across a CCTV Source (FYP)

The system uses TensorFlow Object Detection to fine tune an existing object detection model on a new dataset based on Human Surveillence to be able to detect just humans, also contains a system to track individual humans across multiple frames and associate a time on screen with them.

Currently uses SSD-MobileNetV2, TensorFlow Object Detection API, TensorFlow GPU, ONNX Runtime, OpenCV Python.
